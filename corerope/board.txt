This is a Demonstration Board to show the operation of the so-called "Woven-Wire Read-Only Memory."
This technique is related to the well-known "Core Rope" Read-Only memory used by NASA in Apollo missions
(and not only) in the AGC (Apollo Guidance Computer), but it's simpler.

This project was made from salvaged components, so several design choices were driven by what was available.
Also, many liberties were taken... for example there isn't any comparator to adjust for the 1/0 threshold.
I thought that this function could be performed "by design" by the 1/0 thresholds "built-in" the CMOS logic.

From a building point of view, the design includes:
- the "Woven-Wire" memory itself, described below,
- a Z80 CMOS microprocessor,
- some gates and misc functions,
- a dual 7-segment display,
- two clock generators, one ~50 kHz for the memory and a variable one, from about 
  1 to 10 Hz for the microprocessor.
- clock can also manually provided via an astable 555.

Functionally, the microprocessor reads and executes the previously woven code with wires passing 
in and out of the individual cores.
The sequences of 1's and 0's are nothing more than the translation of the program source code into binary.
Individual lines are activated via a 2N2222 transistor, which is driven by the 4-to-16 decoder connected 
to the first 4 bits of the Address Bus.
Wnen /RD signal is activated from the microprocessor, the corresponding Address Bus address is decoded and
the corresponding 2N2222 is engaged.

The output on the display is driven by the /IORQ line, which triggers both the latching of the data 
present on the Data Bus during the execution of the OUT function and the "blinking," which exists for aesthetic function only. 

The ~50 kHz oscillator, which feeds all the lines in parallel (but of which only one works at a time), has a 4.7nF capacitor 
in series whose capacitive reactance should be a few hundred ohms, enough not to overload the 2N2222 at the other end of the line.

Rectification of the voltage generated on the secondary winding is done with a Schottky diode and a small capacitor.
It is essential, when testing, to check with an oscilloscope that the voltage is not too high; if necessary, add a small load.

However, the 4508 IC is protected internally with clamping diodes and -because it is a CMOS- it has robust, well-defined 
voltage thresholds to detect 0s and 1s. This helps in not detecting "false 1's" resulting from parasitic coupling/crosstalk, etc.

After  the 4508 there's a 74HC245, which, in addition to further hardening the signals (enough to drive the LEDs as well) also 
helps in handling the 3-state, which is necessary to avoid bus-contention during the write phase on the Display.

As written, the design was made with scavenged material, some choices are also a consequence of the layout chosen for the 
components (e.g., the A/B direction of the 74HC245 requiring an inverter).
The use of the 4515 (4 to 16 decoder), with ACTIVE LOW output, needed needed three 4069s to reverse the logic and drive the 2N2222s.
Using a 4514 -with ACTIVE HIGH outputs- would have simplified the wiring avoiding the use of 16 intverters, but alas, I had none available.

Also, reversing the inputs/outputs of 74HC245 would have also spared another inverter, but it would have greatly complicated 
the wiring on the PCB... but since 4069s were already there I didn't think too much about it... ;-)
Let's say that at least 3x4069 could be avoided with little effort.
