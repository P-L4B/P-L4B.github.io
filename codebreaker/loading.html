<h2>CODEBREAKER LOADING FROM AUDIO FILE</h2>
<br>
For standard ACIs:
<br>
You  would start the ACI with C100R at Wozmon command prompt to get the ACI command prompt (a '*').
<br>
Then give the ACI command  <b>07F8.0FFFR</b> to read the AIFF file. UNPAUSE the player simultaneously with pressing <i>RETURN</i> to invoke the command.
<br>
If it does not hang you are back to Wozmon and ready to give the <b>800R</b> <i>RETURN</i> start command.
<br>
<br>
Not extactly user friendly (you have to memorize and type all the addresses) and there is no checksum whatsoever to detect loading errors.
<br>
The standard procedure for Apple-1 ACI is to look if the last two bytes of the cassette load are correct using the Wozmon (even more work !):
<br>
<b>FFE.FFF</b> <i>RETURN</i>
<br>
and for 'Codebreaker' it should spit out the two byte values 7F and 60. Otherwise you have a loading error or the old, buggy version.
<br>
So you have to memorize a lot of bytes.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
For Extended ACI ROMs:<br>
With the 'extended format' page in my ACI PROMs you start  it with <b>C500R</b> <i>RETURN</i>at Wozmon command prompt to get the ACI command prompt. (Note the different address).
<br>
Then, since it is a two block recording, you give the command:<br>
<b>RX RX</b> where each 'RX' means 'read one extended format block'.
<br>
Again, UNPAUSE the recording when hitting <i>RETURN</i>.
<br>
And the game will load, the checksum will be checked, and if it is OK, it will automatically start.
<br>
Much, much more user friendly ! All you need to memorize / write down is the number of blocks. That's it !
<br>	
<br><br>
<br>
On the Apple-II, use:
<br>
<b>CALL -151</b> <i>RETURN</i>
<br>
<b>7F8.FFFR</b>  <i>RETURN</i>
<br>
<b>800G</b> <i>RETURN</i>
<br>
