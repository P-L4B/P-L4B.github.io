<h2>APPLE-1 PROM TESTER</h2>
<br>
<b>PROJECT DESCRIPTION</b><BR>
A quick way to test all the PROMS of the APPLE-1 Computer.<br>
<br>
Each 256x4 PROM contains half a byte (one nibble).<br>
The firmware automatically detects and tests the PROM by comparing each nibble with the original code stored in the Arduino's permanent FLASH.<br>
Each PROM is tested individually. Both WOZ Monitor and Cassette Interface are supported.
<BR><BR>
<BR>
No responsibility is taken in case of damages or whatsoever.<BR>
<BR>
<b>BILL OF MATERIALS</b><br>
An Arduino Nano (or compatible), a breadboard and some wires.<br>
<br>

<br><br><br>
<b>USAGE</b><br>
Disconnect every power source from Arduino.<br>
Connect the PROM as shown in the wiring diagram (or make a PCB using the Gerber file), using all anti-ESD precautions.<br>
Once connected to the power the test will begin immediately. Progress can be seen via terminal (default speed: 115200 baud, N81).<br>
If the PROM is found healthy a "PASS" message will appear in few seconds along with the detected model (The built-in LED will flash in a heartbeat style).<br><br>

<br><br>
In case of failure during the reading an error message will appear (the built-in LED will be lit steadily):<br><br>

Push RESET to test again. Always disconnect the power before removing the PROM.
