This documents describe the two ASM routines that are dedicated to:
- initialization of the HD44780/ST7066 compatible display
- position the cursor in a specific screen location

Both routines rely on the "Shift Register Data Out" ASM Routine.
It is assumed that it has been already loaded/typed in memory.
It is also assumed that the LCD has been wired as follows:
	- LCD'S REGISTER SELECT "RS" CONNECTED TO DIGITAL OUTPUT 1
	- LCD'S DATA LINES "DB0" TO "DB8" CONNECTED TO DIGITAL OUTPUT 9 TO 16
	- LCD'S ENABLE "E" CONNECTED TO CS2 LINE ON THE OUTPUT CONNECTOR. 
	- "CS2" LINE THROUGH-HOLE CONNECTED TO THROUGH-HOLE "B" (ADDR $B000=45056 --> 45056-65536=-20480 IN BASIC)
	- LCD'S "R/W" TO GND, POWER AND CONTRAST BY THE BOOK


-------------------------------------------------------
LCD Initialization (Code starts at $0650, 1616 decimal)
-------------------------------------------------------

To initialize the display just run the routine:
650R {ENTER}

In BASIC just: CALL 1616 {ENTER}

The display will be cleared and a blinking cursor will blink in the upper left corner



---------------------------------------------------
LCD Set Cursor (Code starts at $0700, 1792 decimal)
---------------------------------------------------

This ASM routines uses the following memory locations to read desired cursor row and column:
$0284	(decimal 644)	desired row of display 
$0285	(decimal 645)	desired column of display

The mapping of the Display RAM (DDRAM) in these devices is a bit weird, especially for the row value:
1st row: address $00
2nd row: address $40
3rd row: address $10
4th row: address $50

The desired column value must be added to the corresponding row value, as an offset.
The resulting byte must be written to the Shift Register, toghether with other control signals handled by the routine.

Example: move the cursor to the second row from the top, position number 10.
284: 40 {ENTER}
285: A {ENTER}
700R {ENTER} --> the cursor will blink in the position 10 of the second row from the top.

Example in BASIC: move the cursor to the second row from the top, position number 12.
POKE 644, 120 {ENTER}
POKE 645, 12 {ENTER}
CALL 1792 {ENTER} --> the cursor will blink in the position 12 of the fourth line from the top.



Note:
A "pure" Shift Register technique cannot be used here to generate all the command&control signals.
The SR is simply too slow (32 microseconds for 16 bits): the shitfing bits are easily detected by the display and 
interpreted as commands (and they should not).
This leads to errors in visualization.
Due to the extreme reactivity of these displays it was decided to add a signal to the output connector of the board.
This signal (a standard negative edged Chip Select signal) comes from the onboard demux 74154 through CS2 connection to one of 154's outputs.
Every time any of the addresses related to that memory area is read or written, a LOW signal will be generated for about 500 nanoseconds.
This signal has been used as ENABLE command for the display, at the end of the data preparation on the Shift Register.
