	! APPLE-1 I/O & REAL TIME CLOCK !
	+-------------------------------+


This boards provide:
- 16 Digital Outputs (TTL level) with LEDs
- 8 Analog Inputs (8 bit sampling)
- 4 Digital Inputs (TTL level)
- Battery backed-up Real Time Clock with Calendar
- 1-Wire BUS for the temperature probe DS18B20
- TTL Serial out for ATMEGA debug
- 4 spare LED
- Real Time Clock can be adjusted very easily when needed.


All the functions can be accessed via two short ASM routines, explained in this document.

First routine reads a specific "register" from the ATMEGA. 
The content of this so called "register" can be a hour, a minute, a voltage, a logic level, a temperature... etc.
Register's mapping is shown in the table below.

The second routine is used to output bits in the real world in order to turn on light, spin motors etc.
For monitoring purposes, all 16 output bits are connected to LEDs.

TL;DR 
First routine handles INPUT channels, second handles OUTPUT channels.

Routines can be called from WOZ Monitor and BASIC.

Before wiring CS please read carefully Apple-1 documentation and memory mapping in order to avoid conflicts 
between periperals and potential damages.

VIA's BASE ADDRESS = $2000 (8192 decimal) is assumed from now on (wire between "CS" and "2")
It is also assumed that both routines have been loaded/typed in memory.


---------------------------------------------------------
SINGLE REGISTER READ (code starts at $0600, 1536 decimal)
---------------------------------------------------------

This ASM routines relies on the following memory locations to read desired register and to store its value:
$0280   (640 decimal)	requested ATMEGA register index (see list at the end)
$0281   (641 decimal)	value of requested ATMEGA register

To read a specific ATMEGA register:
- Write register's index in location $0280
- Run the routine
- Read register's value in location $0281

Example: to read the current minute (register=1)
280: 1 {ENTER}
600R {ENTER}
281 {ENTER} --> the current minute of the hour will be displayed


Example in BASIC: to read the analog channel 6 (analog channel 6 = register 15)
POKE 640,15 {ENTER}
CALL 1536 {ENTER}
PRINT PEEK (641) {ENTER} --> sampled value of analog channel 6 will be displayed


Current (v0.64c) register list and content:

  REGISTER  CONTENT
  --------  -----------------------------------------------------
  00        HOUR
  01        MINUTE
  02        SECOND
  03        DAY
  04        MONTH
  05        YEAR
  06        TEMPERATURE FROM RTC
  07        TEMPERATURE FROM DS18B20 (when connected AND enabled)
  08        DECIMAL DIGITS OT THE TEMPERATURE ABOVE (register 07)
  10        ANALOG READ CHANNEL 1
  11        ANALOG READ CHANNEL 2
  12        ANALOG READ CHANNEL 3
  13        ANALOG READ CHANNEL 4
  14        ANALOG READ CHANNEL 5
  15        ANALOG READ CHANNEL 6
  16        ANALOG READ CHANNEL 7
  17        ANALOG READ CHANNEL 8
  20        DIGITAL READ CHANNEL 1
  21        DIGITAL READ CHANNEL 2
  22        DIGITAL READ CHANNEL 3
  23        DIGITAL READ CHANNEL 4
  --------  -----------------------------------------------------


Note to DS18B20 High-Precision Temperature Probe.
Polling this device is VERY time consuming, up to hundreds of milliseconds with the maximum accuracy.
The probe must properly connected to 1-WIRE connector AND enabled AT POWER UP by wiring temporarily the
Digital Inputs D1..D3 according to the following grid:

		D1	D2	D3	D4
EXCLUDED	-	-	-	-	(default condition with no wiring due to internal pull-up Resistors)
9 BIT ACCURACY	0	-	-	-	(resolution=0.5 degrees, conversion time ~95 ms)
10 BIT ACCURACY	-	0	-	-	(resolution=0.25 degrees, conversion time ~190 ms)
11 BIT ACCURACY - 	-	0	-	(resolution=0.125 degrees, conversion time ~375 ms)
12 BIT ACCURACY	-	-	-	0	(resolution=0.0625 degrees, conversion time ~750 ms)

Internal pull-up resistors on Digital Inputs will keep the probe inactive unless a connection to GND is made.

Example: to enable the probe and set it to 11 BIT of accuracy
- With the Apple-1 powered OFF: connect D3 to GND,
- Switch on the Apple-1,
- Remove the connection --> the probe has been enabled and can be read through its registers.






-------------------------------------------------------------
SHIFT REGISTER DATA OUT (code starts at $0630, 1584 decimal )
-------------------------------------------------------------
This routine relies on the following memory locations:
$0282	Shift Register HIBYTE - HEX value representing the binary 1/0 combination desired in output channels 9..16
$0283   Shift Register LOBYTE - HEX value representing the binary 1/0 combination desired in output channels 1..8

The Digital Outputs of this board are meant to be used with Relays, lights and everything that does not require
a high speed switching. Data/bits in previous registers are shifted out at a fraction of Phi2 clock.
Let's assume Phi2 clock = 1 MHz --> 1 cycle is 1 microsecond.
According to 65C22's specifications CB1 Shift Clock is Phi2/2 when SR is under Phi2 control, that is 2 microseconds.
This means that 2*16=32 microseconds will be taken to shift out all 16 bits.

Example: light up all the 16 LEDs corresponding to the Digital Outputs ($FF = binary 11111111)
282: FF {ENTER}
283: FF {ENTER}
630R {ENTER} --> all the 16 LED's will light up

Example in BASIC: light up only the LEDs number 1 and 16 (decimal 1 = binary 00000001, decimal 128 = binary 10000000)
POKE 642,1 {ENTER}
POKE 643,128 {ENTER}
CALL 1584 {ENTER} --> LEDs 1 and 16 will light up


Note to Digital Output connector:
There are 20 LEDs but only 16 are actually connected to Shift Register circuitry. Remaining 4 are meant to be "spare" 
and available to the user for monitoring purposes (TTL levels).
