This operations require basic soldering skills and anti-ESD precautions.<BR>
No responsibility is taken in case of damages or whatsoever.<BR>
<BR>
<b>1)</b> Get and properly program an ESP8266 Wi-Fi modem as indicated here:<BR>
<a href="https://1200baud.wordpress.com/2017/03/04/build-your-own-9600-baud-c64-wifi-modem-for-20/">https://1200baud.wordpress.com/2017/03/04/build-your-own-9600-baud-c64-wifi-modem-for-20/</a>
<br><br>
Modem Firmware is available under the General Public Licence GPLv3 and can also be found here:<br>

<b>2)</b> Only four wires are necessary: +5V, GND, TXData and RXData. RTS and CTS signals of M10's RS232 port will be also connected together.<BR><br>
<b>2.1)</b> Identify the signals and solder a small wire for each of them, as shown in the pictures:<br><br>
YELLOW WIRE: Pin 11 of IC called M24 (not present) must be connected to ESP8266 RX pin<br>
PURPLE WIRE: Throughole shown in the picture, close to IC called M33, must be connected to ESP8266 TX pin<br><br>

<br><br><br>
RED WIRE: 5V from modem connector (not present) pin 6 must be connected to ESP8266 Vin pin<br>
BLACK WIRE: GND from modem connector (not present) pin 2 must be connected to ESP8266 GND pin<br><br>

<br><br><br>
<b>2.2)</b> Connect together pin 4 (RTS - Request to Send) and 5 (CTS - Clear to Send) of the RS232 connector<br><br>

<br><br><br>
<b>2.3)</b> Now solder the four wires to ESP8266 as shown here:<br><br>

<br><br><br>
<b>2.4)</b> Ensure that your work is like this overall view:<br><br>

<br><br><br>
<b>2.5) Properly insulate the Wi-Fi modem to prevent any short circuit with the M10 motherboard.</b><br>
There is a plenty of space in the area shown in the pictures and there will be no difficulties to close the case.
<br><br>
<b>3)</b> Switch on the M10 and select the TELCOM program.<br>
The default communication parameters 37I1E (300 baud, 7 data bits, Ignore parity, 1 stop bit, Line Status Enabled)<br>
must be changed to <b>38N1D</b> (300 baud, 8 data bits, No parity, 1 stop bit, Line Status Disabled).<br><br>
To do this:<br>
- At the <b>Telcom:</b> prompt type: <b>stat 38N1D</b> then press ENTER. (Alternatively: press <b>F3</b> and the word <b>Stat</b> will be typed automatically.<br>
- The <b>Telcom:</b> prompt will appear again. In case of errors a beep sound will be played.<br>
<br>
This setting is necessary only for the first time or as long as the internal battery keeps the settings.
<br><br>
Normally to connect with the modem it is enough to start the internal Terminal program by typing <b>term</b> followed by ENTER key, or by pressing the <b>F4</b> key.<br>
<br>

<br><br><br>
Now press ENTER key once, the familiar boot message of the ESP modem will appear immediately:<br><br>

<br><br><br>
Remember to configure properly SSID and Password of your home Wi-Fi Network by using <b>AT$SSID</b> and <b>AT$PASS</b> commands.<br>
Refer to the links above for the exhaustive list of commands.<br>
Please refer also to M10 Operation Guide in order to get familiar with the features of the M10 Terminal (such as scroll up etc.)<br><br>
After this you will be able to telnet in your favourite BBS or any other supported system!<br><br>

<br><br><br>
Please note:<br>
- 300 baud speed is known to be the most reliable. Faster speed might also work under certain conditions (bursty transfers with little data).<br>
- Due to localized M10's ROMs some characters like for example "~" (tilde), "@" (at), "#" (hash) might be displayed with other characters. This is not a malfunction.<br>
- The extra power consumption of the Wi-Fi Modem is negligible. Usually four 2500 AA NiMh recheargeable batteries will last for an entire day, and even more.<br>
- Your M10 is now in the 21st century, but remember that it is not Y2K compliant! :-)<br>
<br>
Enjoy!<br>
