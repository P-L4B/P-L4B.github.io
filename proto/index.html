<b>NOTES:</b><br>
<ul>
<li>
On the header connector the sequence of the signals is the same of the edge connector <b>EXCEPT the unregulated +12V/-12V power lines</b>.
<br>
They appears "reversed" compared to the edge connector. This has been made to preserve the thickness of the tracks without using "vias" and is not an error.<br>The markings on the PCB are accurate.
<br></li>
<br>
<li>
PCB  takes also into account <b>the reversal of "R" and "T" signals</b> in the original schematic. The markings on the PCB are accurate.
