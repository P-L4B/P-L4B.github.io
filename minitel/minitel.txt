PROJECT DESCRIPTION
-------------------
This ADF-258 WI-FI MODEM is functionally identical to the reference one. 
However, it uses through-hole components and allows the separation of the ESP32 microcontroller, so that it can be used for other projects.


DISCLAIMER
----------
The electronic components used are sensitive to static electricity and may be damaged by it. 
Before any operation on your devices, you must discharge the static electricity accumulated by your body and prevent it from building up again. 
We do not accept any responsibility for damage, even serious or fatal, caused to people / things / intellectual property during the installation or use of this device.
MINITEL ADF-258 also, use LETHAL voltages that can be present even when it's switched off and disconnected from mains. 
NEVER open or tamper with it, for any reason. Again, we take no responsibility for any damage, even lethal, to people, property, intellectual property.


FIRMWARE
--------
Firmware is freely downloadable from the link below, follow the instructions and program your ESP-WROOM-32:
https://github.com/sblendorio/Minitel-ESP32


ASSEMBLY
--------
Solder all the components indicated in the Bill of Materials, the value of the component is printed on to the PCB itself.
ESP32 Dev Board comes with it own 3.3 V internal Voltage Regulator.
It's possible to configure the board to use the Dev Board's internal regulator or the external LD1117V33 (LD33CV).
The choice of the regulator is made by selecting the proper "POWER" jumper settings.
*** The use of the internal regulator can cause overheating, depending on the voltage on the ADF-258 DIN connector.
*** If you are not completely confident, select LD1117.

Modem can be powered in different ways:
1) Directly from ADF-258
2) From Dev Board USB connector

Option 1) may not be available on your model. To find out, just gently connect your Wi-Fi modem to ADF-258's DIN plug and switch on the Minitel.
If modem LED's lights up you're good to go. 
If it stays off you need to power the Modem from the USB connector (Option 2). Use any USB adapter that can supply at least 1000 mA.

To enter the terminal mode:
- Switch on the ADF-258
- Power on the Modem board, if not already powered on by the Minitel itself
- Set the Teletel operating mode with the keys combination FUNZ+M then T
- Set the Terminal speed with the keys combination FUNZ+B then 4
- Finally, enter the Terminal Mode with the keys combination FUNZ+AGENDA

The modem configuration page should appea appear within a couple of seconds.
From here on, follow the easy on-screen instructions and enjoy!
