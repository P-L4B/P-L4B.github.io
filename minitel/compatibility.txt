|  MINITEL ADF-258 WI-FI MODEM - COMPATIBILITY NOTES RELATED TO TELIC ALCATEL "MINITEL R 722 680C" |
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+


ADDITIONAL NOTES
----------------
This ADF-258 WI-FI MODEM (PCB Version 1.00) can be made compatible with TELIC ALCATEL "MINITEL R 722 680C" with a simple modification.
The modification will not prevent the use with the ADF-258, that will remain totally compatible.
Please note that "PCB Version 1.00a" GERBER file -currently available for download- is already updated with the new value.
The BOM has also been updated.


HOW TO
------
Identify the 10 kOhm resistor (Brown-Black-Orange-Gold).
Its value should be about half of what it is now (~5 kOhm), to do so there are several ways:
- solder a 10 kOhm resistor in parallel to the existing one, either on the component or solder side.
- desolder the 10 kOhm resistor and replace it with a 4.7 kOhm.

FIRMWARE
--------
Download the appropriate firmware!
Firmware is freely downloadable from the link below, follow the instructions and program your ESP-WROOM-32:

BOOT
----

Just like with ADF-258, the modem can be powered in different ways:
1) Directly from TELIC ALCATEL "MINITEL R 722 680C"
2) From Dev Board USB connector

Option 1) may not be available on your model. To find out, just gently connect your Wi-Fi modem to TELIC ALCATEL "MINITEL R 722 680C"'s 
DIN plug and switch on the Minitel.
If modem LED's lights up you're good to go. 
If it stays off you need to power the Modem from the USB connector (Option 2). Use any USB adapter that can supply at least 1000 mA.

The terminal mode is immediately available at terminal's boot, there's no need to type in any sequence of keys, so:
- Switch on the ADF-258
- Power on the Modem board, if not already powered on by the Minitel itself

The modem configuration page should appear appear within a couple of seconds.
From here on, follow the easy on-screen instructions and enjoy!
